# AlexDalCinProjects
In this repository you will find 4 files (1 zip, 1 pdf and 2 ipynb)
- AlexDalCin_QRM_coursework: This is a project entirely made in Matlab, made for the Quantitative Risk Management Course. The main reference is T. Roncalli, 2020, Handbook of Financial Risk Management, and most of the part are a replication of this paper. 
- AlexDalCin_SecondQRMProject: This project is entirely made in VBA, this was also made for the Quantitative Risk Management Course. We had to calculate the VaR and MtM of a portfolio made of 2 equity (1 in CCY EUR and 1 in CCY <> EUR), 2 options (1 in CCY EUR and 1 in CCY <> EUR) and 1 Fx Swap. The options were priced by using a B & S model, that is why i created a function that applied it, then I added it in the VBA file with an Add-In.
- allemandri_capparoni_dalcin_AddITTraining: This project is entirely made in Python, this was made for an IT course group project. We had to implement a code, in order to price an European option via Monte Carlo Method. In order to do that, we applied an Euler-Maruyama scheme, which is a widely used framework for SDEs.
- Project_AlexDalCinQFI: This project is entirely made in Python, this was made for Statistical machine learning. I had to perform, first of all, data cleaning. Then, I had to choose a measure that told us which was the best method. Then, I tested several models (from Linear Regression to Neural Network and SVM). Then, I applied the winning method to make an estimation.
